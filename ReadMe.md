## Project Information
After implementing the requirements, I decided to go a bit further to document the API 
using Swagger & deploy the application in azure. This solution uses the following azure services,

- Azure Key vault
- Azure SQL
- Azure Web App ( App Service)
- 
### Azure SQL
This service was used to provision MS-SQL Server which is the database used for this
solution where the log data is stored. The connection string was initially saved
in Azure Key Vault for security reasons but due to limited access of the Azure
Account i used , i was not able to set up AD App Registration for the Key Vault,
so i resulted to storing configuration data in AppSettings file which i'm aware of
the Security vulnerabilities of such approach. So, kindly accept this approach from me
being a Test Code.


### Azure App Service ( PAAS )
The frontend was deployed using Static Web App and the backend deployed with
Azure Web App. Below is the link to access it Deployment URL :

### Deployed API URL :
https://gledu-calculatortest.azurewebsites.net/index.html

### Deployed Frontend :
https://lemon-wave-076186403.1.azurestaticapps.net/




According to the requirement , there are 2 Implementations 
of the Diagnostic Interface. The default concrete implementation is the 
database logger which logs result, operations and timestamp to a MS SQL Server 
Database deployed by Azure SQL Service.

To view the the debugOutput logger , Go to CalculatorTest.API, inside the 
startup.cs file, Uncomment this line & comment the other
```
// services.AddScoped<IDiagnosticLogger,DebugLogger>();
```
### Web API 
To run the API backend , simple follow this steps :
1. Navigate to the API root directory 
   ``` cd  CalculatorTest.API ```
2. Run ``` dotnet build ```
3. Run ``` dotnet run  ```


### Library Test  ( Angular Client)
To run the Library Test, simple follow this steps :
1. Navigate to the API root directory
   ``` cd   GLEducation.Lib.Test  ```
2. Run ``` dotnet build ```
3. Run ``` dotnet test  ```

### Frontend ( Angular Client)
To run client Application, simple follow this steps :

1. Ensure the API is running, the API runs on 
   http port 5000 and https port 5001. The angular app 
   communicate with the Api on port 5000.
2. Navigate to the API root directory
   ``` cd   Calcular.Frontend/client    ```
3. Run ``` npm install ```
4. Run ``` npm run start  ```
